# Valgrind, 10:41 hour CS50

## Overview
Valgrind is a programming tool for memory debugging, memory leak detection, and profiling. It helps developers identify memory-related errors, such as memory leaks, invalid memory access, and improper use of dynamic memory allocation.

## Key Features
- **Memory Leak Detection**: Detects memory that has been allocated but not properly freed.
- **Invalid Memory Access**: Checks for invalid memory access, such as reading or writing to memory that has already been freed or is out of bounds.
- **Profiling**: Measures performance aspects, including cache usage, branch prediction, and heap usage.
- **Thread Debugging**: Detects race conditions and other threading issues.

## Common Tools
- **Memcheck**: Checks for memory errors like leaks, invalid accesses, and misuse of the heap.
- **Cachegrind**: A cache and branch-prediction profiler.
- **Massif**: A heap profiler.
- **Helgrind**: Detects data races in multithreaded programs.
- **DRD**: Detects data races and threading errors.

## Installation
On Debian-based systems (like Ubuntu):
```sh
sudo apt-get update
```

```sh
sudo apt-get install valgrind
```



## Usage
- Compile your program:

```bash
make myprogram
<or>
clang -o myprogram myprogram.c -lcs50
```


- Run you program

```bash
./myprogram
```

## Run Valgrind:

```bash
valgrind ./myprogram
```


- Analyze the output:
Valgrind will produce detailed output about any memory issues it detects.

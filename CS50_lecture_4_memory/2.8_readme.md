# Scope of Variables in C

## Memory Layout in a PC

In a typical C program, memory is divided into several segments, each with its own scope and lifetime. Below is a simplified table describing these segments from top to bottom:

| Segment       | Description                                                                                          |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Machine Code  | The compiled binary code of the program. This is the actual code that gets executed by the CPU.      |
| Globals       | Variables declared outside of any function. These are allocated at program startup and remain until the program ends. |
| Heap          | Memory dynamically allocated during runtime using functions like `malloc()`. The memory here must be manually managed by the programmer. |
| Stack         | Memory used for function calls. It stores local variables, function parameters, and return addresses. Memory in the stack is automatically managed (allocated and deallocated) as functions are called and return. |

### Explanation

- **Machine Code:** This is the lowest level of the program where the instructions are executed. It is static and does not change during program execution.
- **Globals:** These variables have a global scope, meaning they can be accessed from anywhere in the program. They are allocated at the start of the program and deallocated when the program terminates.
- **Heap:** This area of memory is used for dynamic memory allocation. Memory in the heap is allocated during runtime using functions like `malloc()`, `calloc()`, or `realloc()`, and must be freed using `free()` to avoid memory leaks.
- **Stack:** This is used for static memory allocation. It stores function parameters, local variables, and return addresses. Each time a function is called, a new block is pushed onto the stack, and it is popped off when the function returns.

Understanding the scope and lifetime of variables is crucial for efficient memory management and avoiding issues like memory leaks and stack overflows.

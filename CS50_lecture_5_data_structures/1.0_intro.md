## Queue -> FIFO

- enqueue -> adding something to queue
- dequeue -> removing something from queue


## Stacks -> LIFO

- push -> adding something
- pop -> removing something

eg: email

code eg:-

```bash

const int CAPACITY = 50;

typedef struct
{
    persion people[CAPACITY];
    int size;
}
stack;

```
